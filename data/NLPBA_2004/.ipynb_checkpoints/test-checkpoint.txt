O There

O CONCLUSION
O :
B-cell_type Monocytes
O ,

O ,

I-cell_type cells
O in

I-cell_type lymphocytes
O via

O .

O Apoptosis
O induced
O by
O DNA
O damage
O and
O other
O stresses
O can
O proceed
O via
O expression
O of
B-protein Fas
I-protein ligand
O (
B-protein FasL
O )
O and
O ligation
O of
O its
O receptor
O ,
O Fas
O (
O CD95
O )
O .

O We
O report
O that
O activation
O of
O the
O two
B-protein transcription
I-protein factors
I-protein NF-kappa
I-protein B
I-protein and
I-protein AP-1
O is
O crucially
O involved
O in
B-protein FasL
O expression
O induced
O by
O etoposide
O ,
O teniposide
O ,
O and
O UV
O irradiation
O .

O A
B-protein nondegradable
I-protein mutant
O of
B-protein I
I-protein kappa
I-protein B
O blocked
O both
B-protein FasL
O expression
O and
O apoptosis
O induced
O by
O DNA
O damage
O but
O not
O Fas
O ligation
O .

O These
O stimuli
O also
O induced
O the
O stress-activated
O kinase
O pathway
O (
O SAPK/JNK
O )
O ,
O which
O was
O required
O for
O the
O maximal
O induction
O of
O apoptosis
O .

O A
O 1.2
O kb
B-DNA FasL
I-DNA promoter
O responded
O to
O DNA
O damage
O ,
O as

O as
O coexpression

O .

O Mutations
O in
O the
O relevant
B-DNA NF-kappa
I-DNA B
I-DNA and

O eliminated
O these

O .

O Thus
O ,
O activation
O of
B-protein NF-kappa
I-protein B
O and

O contributes
O to
O stress-induced

O via

O Despite

O research
O ,
O the
O role
O of
B-protein CD40
O signaling
O in
O B
O cell
O terminal
O differentiation
O remains
O controversial
O .

O Here
O we
O show
O that
B-protein CD40
O engagement
O arrests
O B
O cell
O differentiation
O prior
O to
O plasma
O cell
O formation
O .

O This
O arrest
O is
O manifested
O at
O a
O molecular
O level
O as
O a
O reduction
O in
O mRNA
O levels
O of
O secretory
O immunoglobulin
O gene
O products
O such
O as
O mu
O (

O and
O J
O chain
O as
O well
O as
O the
O loss
O of
O the
B-protein transcriptional
I-protein regulator
B-protein BLIMP-1
O .

O Furthermore
O ,
O the
O inhibition
O of
O B
O cell
O differentiation
O by
B-protein CD40
O engagement
O could
O not
O be
O overcome
O by
O either
B-protein mitogens
O or

O ,
O but
O could
O be
O reversed
O by
O antibodies
O that
O interfere
O with
O the
B-protein CD40
O /
B-protein gp39
O interaction
O .

O These
O data
O suggest
O that
O secretory
O immunoglobulin
O is
O not
O produced
O by
B-cell_type B

O that

O alpha-Lipoic
O acid
O (
O LA
O )
O is
O taken
O up
O by
O cells
O and
O reduced
O to
O its
O potent

O ,
O dihydrolipoate
O (
O DHLA
O )
O ,
O much
O of

O .

O To
O improve
O retention
O in

O ,
O the

O .

O The
O protonated

O of
O the

O .

O The
O uptake
O of
O LA-Plus
O by
B-cell_type human
I-cell_type Wurzburg
I-cell_type T

O was
O higher
O compared
O to
O that
O of

O .

O Several-fold
O higher
O amounts
O of
O DHLA-Plus
O ,
O the
O corresponding
O reduced

O of

O ,
O were
O detected
O in

O treated
O cells
O compared
O to
O the
O amount
O of

O found
O in

O treated

O .

O At

O Both
O LA
O and

O synergised
O with

O in

O .

O At

O OBJECTIVE
O :
O Carrier
O identification
O in

O can
O be
O based
O on
O the

O non-random
O X
O inactivation
O (
O NRXI
O )
O in
B-cell_type affected
I-cell_type blood
I-cell_type cell
I-cell_type lineages
O when
O growth
O is
O impaired
O in
O cells
O expressing
O the
B-DNA abnormal
I-DNA gene
O .

O We
O examined
O the
O utility
O of
O seeking
O evidence
O of
O NRXI
O to
O test
O the
O carrier
O status
O of
O women
O in
O families
O affected
O by
O X-linked
O severe
O combined
O immunodeficiency
O (
O XSCID
O )
O and
O X-linked
O hypogammaglobulinaemia
O (
O XLH
O )
O ,
O to
O identify
O as
O carriers
O the
O mothers
O of
O boys
O with
O SCID
O or
O hypogammaglobulinaemia
O whose
O phenotype
O suggested
O X-linkage
O and
O to
O infer
O X-linkage
O in
O boys
O with
O SCID
O or
O hypogammaglobulinaemia
O whose
O disease
O was
O not
O clearly
O X-linked
O on
O the
O basis
O either
O of
O family
O history
O or
O clinical
O and
O immunological
O characteristics
O .

O METHODOLOGY
O :
O A
O polymerase
O chain
O reaction-based
O method
O was
O used
O to
O amplify
O a
O polymorphic
B-DNA CAG
I-DNA repeat
O in
O the
B-DNA first
I-DNA exon
O of
O the
B-DNA androgen
I-DNA receptor
I-DNA gene
O after
O selective
O digestion
O of
O the
B-DNA active
I-DNA X
I-DNA chromosome
O with
O a
B-protein methylation-sensitive
I-protein enzyme
O ,
B-protein HpaII
O to
O distinguish
O between
O the
B-DNA paternal
I-DNA and
I-DNA maternal
I-DNA alleles
O and
O to
O identify
O their
O methylation
O status
O .

O RESULTS
O :
O Heterozygosity
O was
O found
O in
O 24
O of
O 31
O female
O subjects
O (
O 77
O %
O )
O .

O As
O anticipated
O ,
O NRXI
O could
O be
O demonstrated
O in
O all
B-cell_type lymphoid
I-cell_type cells
O studied
O from
O obligate
O carriers
O of
O XSCID
O and
O an
O obligate
O carrier
O of
O XLH
O but
O not
O on
O a
O carrier
O of
O X-linked
O immunodeficiency
O with
B-protein hyper-IgM
O .

O The
O finding
O of
O NRXI
O in
O the
O mother
O of
O a
O boy
O with
O a
O SCID
O variant
O showed
O her
O to
O be
O a
O carrier
O of
O XSCID
O and
O establishes
O that
O her
O son
O has
O XSCID
O ,
O not
O otherwise
O evident
O from

O data
O .

O CONCLUSIONS
O :
O This
O PCR
O assay
O provides
O a
O rapid
O method
O for
O carrier
O detection
O of
O X-linked
O immunodeficiencies
O ,
O and
O has
O allowed

O to
O expand
O the

I-protein B
O in
O ex

O .

B-protein NF-kappa
I-protein B
O activation
O is
O at
O least
O partially
O dependent
O on

O stress
O ,
O since
O the
O antioxidant
O thioctic

O significantly
O lowered

B-protein Stem

O (

O )
O and
B-protein erythropoietin
O (

O )
O work

O ,
O but
O the

O is

O .

O By

I-cell_line human
I-cell_line erythroid
I-cell_line colony-forming
I-cell_line cells
O (
B-cell_line ECFC
O )
O ,
O we
O have
O found
O that
B-protein SCF
O and

O synergistically
O activate
B-protein MAP
I-protein kinase
O (
B-protein MAPK
O ,
B-protein ERK1/2
O )
O ,
O which
O correlates
O with
O the
O cell

O and
O thus
O may
O be
O responsible
O for
O the

O .

O Treatment
O of

O and
O wortmannin
O ,
O inhibitors
O of

O and

I-protein kinase
O ,
O respectively
O ,
O inhibited
O the
O synergistic
O activation
O of
B-protein MAPK
O and
O also
O the
O cell
O growth
O ,
O further
O supporting
O this
O conclusion
O .

O Wortmannin
O only
O inhibits
B-protein MAPK
O activation
O induced
O by
B-protein EPO
O but
O not
O that
O by

O ,
O suggesting
O that
B-protein SCF
O and
B-protein EPO
O may
O activate
B-protein MAPK
O through

O pathways
O ,
O which
O would
O facilitate
O synergy
O .

O Furthermore
O ,
B-protein EPO
O ,
O but
O not
B-protein SCF
O ,
O led
O to
O activation
O of
B-protein STAT5
O ,
O whereas
B-protein SCF
O and
O wortmannin
O had
O no
O effect
O on
O the
B-protein EPO
O -induced
B-protein STAT5
O activation
O ,

O that
B-protein STAT5
O is
O not
O involved
O in
O the
O synergistic
O action
O of
B-protein SCF
O and

O .

O Together
O ,
O the
O data

O that

O Structure

O of

I-protein hormone
I-protein receptor
O .

O The

I-protein receptor
O is

I-protein protein
O which
O possesses
O three
O distinct
O domains
O ,
O one
O that

O and

O steroids
O ,
O one
O that
O binds
O DNA
O ,
O and
O one
O that
O binds
B-protein anti-receptor
I-protein antibodies
O and
O is
O required
O for
O glucocorticoid
O modulation
O of
O gene
O expression
O .

O In
O intact
O cells
O ,
O receptor
O number
O ,
O affinity
O and
O activity
O can
O change
O in
O response
O to
O factors
O that
O bind
O to
O the
O receptor
O ,
O or
O that
O act
O indirectly
O through
O ill-defined
O mechanisms
O which
O may
O include
O resumption
O or
O arrest
O of
O cell
O cycling
O and
O variations
O in
O intracellular
O calcium
O ion
O concentrations
O .

O Some
O of
O these
O factors
O appear
O to
O exert
O their
O effect
O by
O controlling
O critical
O receptor
O properties
O such
O as
O ATP-dependent
O phosphorylation
O ,
O integrity
O of
B-protein thiol
I-protein groups
O ,
O and
O exposure
O of
B-protein key
I-protein amino
I-protein acid
I-protein residues
O .

O Glucocorticoid
O agonists
O promote
O the
O 'transformation
O '
O of
O the
O receptor
O into
O the
O DNA-binding
O state
O ,
O which
O is
O competent
O for
O modulating
O gene
O expression
O .

O Glucocorticoid
O antagonists
O are
O steroids
O that
O interact
O with
O the
O receptor
O but
O either
O fail
O to
O produce
O a
B-protein stable
I-protein complex
O or
O produce
O a
B-protein stable
I-protein but
I-protein inefficient
I-protein complex
O .

O Although
O substituent
O groups
O that
O confer
O agonist
O or

O activity
O to
O the
O steroid
O have
O been
O identified
O ,
O the
O molecular
O determinants
O of
O this
O difference
O at
O the
O receptor
O level
O remain
O unknown
O .

O Most
O in
O vitro
O and
O in
O vivo
O data
O on
O receptor
O regulation
O can
O be
O accommodated
O by
O postulating
O the
O existence
O of
O an
O intracellular
O cycle
O that
O involves
O five
O states
O of
O the
O receptor
O .

O The
O active
O free
O receptor
O is
O phosphorylated
O ,
O reduced
O ,
O and
O presumably
O oligomeric
O (
O state
O A
O )
O .

O Following
O binding
O of
O an
O agonist
O (
O state
O B
O )
O ,
O it
O can
O become
O transformed
O by
O dissociation
O into
O its
O subunits
O and
O dephosphorylation
O (
O state
O C
O )
O .

O The
B-protein transformed
I-protein receptor
O then
O interacts
O with
B-DNA chromatin
O (
O state
O D
O )
O .

O Dissociation
O of
O the
O steroid
O and
O oxidation
O of
B-protein receptor
I-protein thiol
I-protein group
O (
O s
O )
O lead
O to
O the
O inactive
O receptor
O form
O (
O state
O E
O )
O .

O Reduction
O and
O rephosphorylation
O of
O the
O receptor
O enable
O it
O to
O bind
O steroids
O again
O so
O that
O the

O is
O closed
O .

O The

O were

O The

O The

O (

O Enthalpy

O BACKGROUND
O :

O Although

O We

O Despite

O .

O Treatment
O of

O D
O ,
O which

O .

O In

O either

O We

O of
O the

O .

O Whereas

O )
O cross-linking
O alone
O stimulated
O increased
O expression
O of
B-protein CD86
O ,
O up-regulation
O of
B-protein CD80
O required
O dual
O stimulation
O with
B-protein anti-IgM
O and

O .

O The

O contributed
O by

O ,
O toward
O both
B-protein CD80

O ,
O was
O the

O (

O )
O ,
O recruited
O by

O .

O This
O alone
O was
O sufficient
O to
O generate
O an
O increase
O in

O levels
O .

O However
O ,
B-protein CD80

O was
O identified
O to

O .

O The

O of
O cross-talk
O between
B-protein BCR
O -mobilized
O Ca
O (

O and
O CD54-derived

O .

O This

O between
O Ca
O (

O ,
O culminating

O Our

O is

O .

O We

O Previous

O can
O also
O result

O We

O after

O .

O We
O show
O that
O activation
O of
B-cell_type T
I-cell_type cells
O with

O alone
O elicits
O a
O small
B-protein IFN-gamma
O and
B-protein TNF-alpha
O response
O with

O .

O Similarly
O ,
O no

O are
O seen
O in

O alone
O .

O However
O ,

O with

O results
O in

O .

O This

O In

I-cell_type alpha-

O .

O Here

O Therefore

O On

O BACKGROUND
O :

O CONCLUSIONS
O :
O An
O imbalance

O levels
O results
O in
O failure
O of

O hepatic

O at

O .

O Activation
O of

I-protein B
O in
O the
O liver
O promotes
B-protein proinflammatory
I-protein cytokine
O and

I-protein molecule
O synthesis
O .

O These
O result
O in
O oxygen-derived
O free
O radical

O and
O neutrophil
O recruitment
O ,
O further
O contributing
O to

O .

O Various

O ,
O the

O The

I-cell_type berghei-infected
I-cell_type erythrocytes
O and
O was

O .

O There
O was
O comparable
O activation
O of

O in

I-cell_type cells
O .

O The

O Role

O Mammary
O development
O depends
O on

O ,
O namely
O the
O bifurcation
O and

O of
O ductal
O growth
O points
O (
O end

O )
O and
O secretory
O lobules
O into
O a
O more
O or

O fatty
O stroma
O .

O Because
O breast
O carcinomas
O are
O overwhelmingly
O ductal
O in

O ,
O this
O review
O focuses
O on

O influences

O is
O only
O the

O account
O of
O the
O role
O of
O embryonic
O stroma
O (
O mesenchyme
O )
O .

O The

O as
O the
O necessary
O target
O for

O mammogens
O and
O the
O source

O and
O the

O of
O mammary
O epithelium-induced
O modifications
O of
O the

O stroma
O is
O emphasized
O .

O Evidence
O is

O that
O if
O they
O are
O to
O grow
O ,
O end

O must
O condition
O proximal
O fatty
O stroma
O by

B-cell_type white

O as
O well
O as
O inducing
O stromal
O cell
O division
O and
O ,
O possibly
O ,

O .

O The

O end
O bud
O is
O described
O and
O its
O likely

O ductal
O morphogen
O is
O discussed
O ;
O a

O are

O ,
O a

B-protein growth
I-protein factor-beta
O is
O highly

O and
O is

O .

O Finally
O ,
O a
O need
O for
O new
O conceptual
O and

O stromal-epithelial
O signaling
O is
O discussed
O .

B-protein Adipophilin
O is
O a
O sensitive
O marker
O for
O lipid
O loading
O in
B-cell_type human
I-cell_type blood
I-cell_type monocytes
O .

B-protein Adipophilin
O ,
O a
O marker
O of
O lipid
O accumulation
O initially
O described
O in
B-cell_type adipocytes
O ,
O was
O recently
O shown
O to
O be
O induced
O in
B-cell_type macrophage
I-cell_type foam
I-cell_type cells
O .

O We
O found
O that
O even
B-cell_type freshly
I-cell_type isolated
I-cell_type blood
I-cell_type monocytes
O express
B-protein adipophilin
O and
O that
O the
O amount
O of
B-protein adipophilin
I-protein protein
O is
O variable
O in
B-cell_type monocytes
O from
O different
O healthy
O individuals
O .

O However
O ,
O the
O physiological
O expression
O of
B-protein adipophilin
O does
O not
O correlate
O with
O the
O levels
O of
O free
O fatty
O acids
O ,
O cholesterylesters
O or
O free
O cholesterol
O .

B-protein Enzymatically
I-protein modified
I-protein low-density
I-protein lipoprotein
O (
B-protein E-LDL
O )
O induces
O rapid
O foam
O cell
O formation
O in
B-cell_type monocytes
O and
O upregulates
B-protein adipophilin
O mRNA
O and
O protein
O within
O 2
O h
O of
O incubation
O .

O This
O rapid
O induction
O of
B-protein adipophilin
O is
O accompanied
O by
O a
O significant
O increase
O of
O free
O fatty
O acids
O in
B-cell_type monocytes
O incubated
O with
B-protein E-LDL
O .

B-protein Adipophilin
O facilitates
O the
O uptake
O of
O free
O fatty
O acids
O ,
O and
O here
O we
O demonstrate
O that
O free
O fatty

O increase
O is
O related
O to
O the
O early
O upregulation
O of
O adipophilin
O expression
O in
B-cell_type blood
I-cell_type monocytes
O .

O Fatty
O acids
O are
O ligands
O for
B-protein peroxisome
I-protein proliferator-activated
I-protein receptor-gamma
O (

O )
O ,

I-RNA mRNA
O by
B-protein PPARgamma
O agonists
O like
O 15d-PGJ
O (
O 2
O )
O and
O ciglitazone
O indicates

O maturing
B-cell_type dendritic

O ,
O 2.5
O micromol/L
O sulfasalazine
O upregulated
O the

O From

O expression
O ,
O we
O found
O an

O ID50

O .

O The
O apparent
O ID50
O value
O for

O maturation
O was
O 4
O micromol/L
O .

O Sulfapyridine
O had

O micromol/L
O ,
O sulfasalazine
O largely
O inhibited

O .

O CONCLUSION
O :
B-cell_type Maturing
I-cell_type human
I-cell_type dendritic
I-cell_type cells
O are
O hundred-fold
O more
O sensitive
O to
O sulfasalazine
O than

I-cell_type cells
O and

O Thus
O ,

O maturation
O is
O an

O in

B-cell_line lymphocytic

O We

O These

B-protein Stat6
O has

O To

O ,
O we

I-protein IL-4R

O ,
B-protein Y497F
O ,
O which

O .

O The

I-protein hIL-4Ralpha
O ,
O was

O .

O Upon

O worked
O as
O well
O as
O the

O in
O driving
O Th2
O differentiation
O ,
O as
O measured
O by
O Gata3
O up-regulation
O and
O IL-4
O production
O .

O Furthermore
O ,
O IL-4-driven
O cell
O expansion
O was
O also
O normal
O in
O the
O cells
O infected
O with
B-protein Y497F
O ,
O although

O with
B-protein Y497F
O were
O not
O capable
O of
O phosphorylating
B-protein insulin
I-protein receptor

I-protein 2
O .

O These

O is
O dispensable
O for

O .

O Both
B-protein WT

O lose

O MATERIALS

O :
O The

B-protein TGF-beta1
O and

O ,
O and
O protein
O expression
O and

O (

O .

O RESULTS
O :
B-protein TPO
O enhanced
O the
O proliferation
O of
B-cell_line Mo-7e
I-cell_line cells
O as
O determined
O by
O 3H-thymidine
O incorporation
O ,
O whereas
B-protein TGF-beta1
O suppressed
O baseline
O cell
O growth
O and
O antagonized
O the
O proliferative
O effect
O of
B-protein TPO
O .

B-protein TPO
O -induced
O proliferation
O also
O was
O reduced
O by
O a
O specific
O inhibitor
O of
O the
B-protein mitogen-activated
I-protein protein
I-protein kinase
O (

O (

O ,
O which

I-protein kinases
O (
B-protein ERK
O )
B-protein ERK1
O and

O ,
O and
O AG490
O ,
O an
O inhibitor
O of
B-protein Janus
I-protein kinase-2
O ,
O which
O completely
O blocked
B-protein TPO
O -induced
O proliferation
O .

O As
O demonstrated
O by
O Western
O blotting
O ,
B-protein TGF-beta1
O reduced

O and
O STAT5
O phosphorylation
O in
B-cell_line Mo-7e
I-cell_line and
I-cell_line HEL
I-cell_line cells
O .

O This
O effect
O was
O completely
O reversed
O by
O preincubation
O with
O a
O tyrosine
O phosphatase
O inhibitor
O (
O Na3VO4
O )
O ,
O which
O suggests
O that
B-protein TGF-beta1
O activated
O a
B-protein phosphatase
O .

O Although
B-protein STAT3
O also
O was
O activated
O by
B-protein TPO
O ,
B-protein STAT3
O activation
O remained
O unaltered
O by
B-protein TGF-beta1
O .

O CONCLUSION
O :
O Taken
O together
O ,
O these
O data
O suggest
O that
B-protein TGF-beta1
O modulates
B-protein TPO
O -mediated
O effects
O on
O megakaryocytic
O proliferation
O by

O with
B-protein TPO

O Our

O Although

O ,
O a

O .

O To

O Several

O This

O D609
O inhibits

O as

O .

O Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate
O (
O D609
O )
O has
O been
O extensively
O studied
O in
O biological
O systems
O and
O exhibits
O a
O variety
O of
O biological
O functions
O ,
O including
O antiviral
O ,
O antitumor
O ,
O and
O anti-inflammatory
O activities
O .

O Most
O of
O these
O activities
O have
O been
O largely
O attributed
O to
O the
O inhibitory
O effect
O of
O D609
O on
O phosphatidylcholine-specific
B-protein phospholipase
I-protein C
O .

O However
O ,
O as
O a
O xanthate
O derivative
O ,
O D609
O is
O a
O strong
O electrolyte
O and
O readily
O dissociates
O to
O xanthate
O anions
O and
O cations
O of
O alkali
O metals
O in
O solution
O .

O Xanthate
O anions
O and
O protonated
O xanthic
O acid
O contain
O a
O free
O thiol
O moiety
O and
O are
O highly
O reductive
O .

O This
O implies
O that
O D609
O and
O other
O xanthate
O derivatives
O may
O function
O as
O potent
O antioxidants
O .

O Indeed
O ,
O we
O found
O that
O D609
O inhibited
O the
O Fenton
O reaction-induced
O oxidation
O of
O dihydrorhodamine
O 123
O in
O a
O dose-dependent
O manner
O similar
O to
O that
O of
O pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate
O ,
O a
O well
O known
O antioxidant
O .

O In
O addition
O ,
O D609
O inhibited

O spin
O adducts
O and

O Moreover
O ,
O when

O was

O to

O 10

O )
O ,
O it
O protected
O the

O from

O .

O Thus
O ,
O these

O indicate
O that
O D609
O is
O a

O and
O has
O the
O ability
O to

O Inhibition
O of

O .

O The
O immunosuppressive
O effects
O of
O glucocorticoids
O arise
O largely
O by
O inhibition
O of
O cytokine
O gene
O expression
O ,
O which
O has
O been
O ascribed
O to
O interference
O between
O the
B-protein glucocorticoid
I-protein receptor
O and

I-protein factors
O such
O as
B-protein AP-1
O and
B-protein NF-kappa
I-protein B
O as
O well
O as
O by

O for

O coactivators
O .

O Here

O inhibition
O of
O interleukin-2
O mRNA
O expression
O in
B-cell_type activated
I-cell_type normal
I-cell_type T
I-cell_type cells
O required

O synthesis
O ,
O suggesting
O that
O this
O phenomenon
O is
O secondary
O to
O expression
O of
O glucocorticoid-regulated
B-DNA genes
O .

O One
O of

O most
O prominent
O glucocorticoid-induced
B-DNA genes
O is
B-DNA glucocorticoid-induced
I-DNA leucine
I-DNA zipper
O (

O )
O ,
O which

O to
O inhibit

O of

O .

O Indeed
O ,
O transient

O blocked

O of

O .

O This

O in

O .

O Similar
O to

O ,

O induces

O This

O INTERVENTIONS
O :

O MEASUREMENTS

O RESULTS
O :

O Inhaled

O CONCLUSION
O :
O Inhaled

O attenuates
O LPS-induced

O ,
O possibly
O by

O production
O in

O .

O The
O mechanism

O may

O Recent
O studies

O of

O However
O ,
O it
O remains
O unclear
O whether

O plays
O a
O role
O in

O and
O whether

O can
O be
O used
O for
O the
O therapy
O of

O .

O Here
O ,

O analyzed
O the
O effects
O of
O locally
O antagonizing
B-protein GATA-3

O in

O .

O We

I-DNA start
I-DNA site
O of

O ,
O whereas

O .

O In
O a
O murine
O model
O of

O associated
O with
O allergic
O pulmonary
O inflammation
O and
O hyperresponsiveness
O in
O ovalbumin
O (
O OVA
O )
O -sensitized
O mice
O ,
O local
O intranasal
O administration
O of
O fluorescein
O isothiocyanate-labeled
O GATA-3
O antisense
O oligonucleotides
O led
O to

O uptake
O in
B-cell_type lung
I-cell_type cells
O associated
O with
O a
O reduction
O of
O intracellular
O GATA-3
O expression
O .

O Such
O intrapulmonary
O blockade
O of
O GATA-3
O expression
O caused
O an
O abrogation
O of
O signs
O of
O lung
O inflammation
O including
O infiltration
O of
B-cell_type eosinophils
O and
B-cell_type Th2
O cytokine
O production
O .

O Furthermore
O ,
O treatment
O with
O antisense
O but
O not
O nonsense
O oligonucleotides
O induced
O a

O in

O mice
O to

O These

O a
O critical
O role
O for
B-DNA GATA-3
O in
O the
O effector
O phase
O of

O and
O suggest
O that

O may
O be
O a
O novel
O approach
O for
O the
O treatment
O of

O .

O This
O approach
O has
O the
O potential

O of
O suppressing
O the

B-DNA Pax5
O appears

B-DNA Pax5
O thus

B-protein STAT3
O is
O constitutively

O in

O vera
O .

O OBJECTIVE
O :
O Polycythemia
O vera
O is
O a
O clonal
O stem
O cell
O disorder
O characterized
O by
O hyperproliferation
O of
O the
B-cell_type erythroid
I-cell_type ,
I-cell_type myeloid
I-cell_type ,
I-cell_type and

O .

O While
O it
O has
O been
O shown
O that
B-cell_type progenitor
I-cell_type cells
O of
O P.
O vera
O patients
O are
O hypersensitive
O to
O several
O growth
O factors
O including

O ,

I-protein growth
I-protein factor-1
O ,
B-protein thrombopoietin
O ,
B-protein interleukin-3
O ,
O and
B-protein granulocyte/monocyte
I-protein colony-stimulating
I-protein factor
O ,
O the
O molecular
O pathogenesis
O of
O this
O disease
O remains
O unknown
O .

O Growth
O factor
O hypersensitivity
O could
O be
O mediated
O by
O changes
O in
O signal
O transduction
O pathways
O .

O We
O therefore
O investigated
O a
O common
O downstream
O effector
O of
B-protein cytokines
O ,
O the
B-protein signal
I-protein transducers
I-protein and
I-protein activators
I-protein of
I-protein transcription
O (
B-protein STATs
O )
O .

O A
O constitutive
O activation
O of

I-protein factors
O could
O explain
O the
O increased
O proliferation
O of
B-cell_type P.
I-cell_type vera
I-cell_type cells
O even
O in
O the
O absence
O of
O growth
O factor
O stimulation
O .

O METHODS
O :
B-cell_type Peripheral
I-cell_type granulocytes
O from
O patients
O with
O P.
O vera
O and
O from
O healthy
O volunteers
O were
O assayed
O for
B-protein STAT1
I-protein ,
I-protein 3
I-protein ,
I-protein and
I-protein 5
O DNA
O binding
O by
O electrophoretic
O mobility

O assay
O .

O RESULTS
O :
O Four
O of
O 14
O P.
O vera
O patients
O analyzed
O showed
O constitutive
O STAT3
O DNA
O binding
O in
B-cell_type unstimulated
I-cell_type peripheral
I-cell_type granulocytes
O ,
O while
O none
O of
O the
O 17
O healthy
O volunteers
O tested
O did
O .

O None
O of
O the
O subjects
O showed
O constitutive
B-protein STAT1
O or
B-protein STAT5
O activity
O .

O Western
O blotting
O demonstrated
O that
O ,
O in
O the
O three
O patients
O ,
B-protein STAT3
O is
O constitutively
O phosphorylated
O on
O Tyr
O 705
O ,
O whereas
O it
O is
O unphosphorylated
O in
O the
O other
O patients
O and
O in
O controls
O .

O Interestingly
O ,
O constitutive
B-protein STAT3
O activity
O did
O not
O correlate
O with
O the
O duration
O of
O disease
O or
O the
O treatment
O regimen
O .

O It
O was
O observed
O in
O a
O recently
O diagnosed
O patient
O and
O in
O two
O patients
O treated
O only
O with
O phlebotomy
O .

O CONCLUSION
O :
O Our
O data
O suggest
O that
O constitutive
O phosphorylation
O and
O activation
O of
B-protein STAT3
O is
O not
O a
O secondary
O event
O induced
O by
O mutagenizing
O agents
O or
O by
O prolonged
O hyperproliferation
O of
B-cell_type hematopoietic
I-cell_type cells
O ,
O but
O rather
O represents
O a
O primary

O that

O To

O Over

O In

O We

O We

O :
B-cell_type T
I-cell_type cells
O were
O treated
O with
B-protein anti-CD2
I-protein antibodies
O or
O cells
O bearing
O the
O natural
B-protein CD2
I-protein ligand
I-protein CD58
O ,
O after
O which
O signaling
O through

I-protein transcription
I-protein factors
O was
O assessed
O .

O RESULTS
O :
O Stimulation
O of
B-protein CD2
O on
B-cell_type primary
I-cell_type T
I-cell_type lymphocytes
O leads
O to
O the
O tyrosine
O phosphorylation
O ,
O nuclear
O translocation
O ,
O and
O DNA
O binding
O of
B-protein STAT1
O .

O In
O contrast
O to
O stimulation
O by
B-protein cytokines
O ,
O the
O activation
O of
B-protein STAT1
O in
O response
O to
O CD2
O ligation
O is
O delayed
O and
O does
O not
O involve
B-protein Jak
I-protein kinases
O .

O Furthermore
O ,
O while
O STAT
O phosphorylation
O induced
O by
B-protein cytokines
O is
O generally
O transient
O ,
O STAT1
O phosphorylation
O following
O CD2
O stimulation
O persists
O for
O a
O period
O of

O .

O Transcription
O of
O key

O genes
O such
O as
B-DNA IRF1
O and
B-DNA c-fos
O proceeds
O with
O delayed
O kinetics
O following

O stimulation
O ,
O suggesting
O that
O this
O unique
O pattern
O of
O STAT
O activation
O may
O lead
O to
O a
O distinct
O cellular
O response
O following
O CD2
O ligation
O .

O This
O pathway
O appears
O to
O be
O restricted
O to
B-cell_type T
I-cell_type cells
O ,
O as
O stimulation
O of

O CONCLUSION
O :
O Stimulation
O of
B-cell_type T
I-cell_type cells
O through
B-protein cell-surface
I-protein molecules
O such
O as
B-protein CD2
O involves
O activation
O of
B-protein STAT
I-protein transcription
I-protein factors
O ,
O thus
O recapitulating
O elements
O of

O signaling
O .

B-protein NFATc1
O and
B-protein NFATc2
O together
O control
O both
O T
O and
O B
O cell
O activation
O and

O .

B-protein NFAT
I-protein transcription
I-protein factors
O play
O critical
O roles
O in
O gene
O transcription
O during
O immune
O responses
O .

O To
O investigate
O further
O the
O two
O most
O prominent
B-protein NFAT
I-protein family
I-protein members
O ,
B-protein NFATc1
O and
B-protein NFATc2
O ,
O we
O generated
O mice
O bearing
O lymphoid
O systems
O devoid
O of
O both
O .

O Doubly
O deficient
B-cell_type T
I-cell_type cells
O displayed
O cell
O surface
O markers
O of
O activation
O yet
O were
O significantly
O deficient
O in
O the
O development
O of
O multiple
O effector
O functions
O ,
O including
B-protein Th
I-protein cytokine
O production
O ,
B-protein surface
I-protein effector
I-protein molecule
O expression
O ,
O and
O cytolytic
O activity
O .

O Nevertheless
O ,
B-cell_type doubly
I-cell_type deficient
I-cell_type B
I-cell_type cells
O were
O hyperactivated
O ,
O as
O evidenced
O by
O extremely
O elevated
O serum
B-protein IgG1
O and
B-protein IgE
O ,
O as
O well
O as
B-cell_type plasma
I-cell_type cell
O expansion
O and
O infiltration
O of
O end
O organs
O .

O Thus
O ,
O in
B-cell_type T
I-cell_type cells
O ,
B-protein NFATc1
O and
B-protein NFATc2
O are
O dispensable
O for
O inflammatory
O reactivity
O but
O are
O required
O for
O effector
O differentiation
O ,
O while
O in
B-cell_type B
I-cell_type cells
O ,
B-protein NFATs
O regulate
O both
O normal
O homeostasis
O and
O differentiation
O .

O Epstein-barr
O virus
B-protein immediate-early
I-protein protein
I-protein BZLF1
O is
O SUMO-1

O leukemia
O bodies
O .

O Although
O the
B-protein immediate-early
I-protein proteins
O of
O both
O herpes
O simplex
O virus
O (
O HSV
O )
O and
O cytomegalovirus
O (
O CMV
O )
O are
O known
O to
O modify
O promyelocytic
O leukemia
O (
O PML
O )
O (
O ND10
O )
O bodies
O in
O the
O nucleus
O of
O the
O host
O cell
O ,
O it
O has
O been
O unclear
O whether
O lytic
O infection
O with
O gamma
O herpesviruses
O induces
O a
O similar
O effect
O .

O The
B-protein PML
I-protein protein
O is
O induced
O by
B-protein interferon
O ,
O involved
O in
B-protein major
I-protein histocompatibility
I-protein complex
I-protein class
I-protein I
O presentation
O ,
O and
O necessary
O for
O certain
O types

O .

O Therefore
O ,
O it
O is
O likely
O that
O PML
O bodies
O function
O in
O an
O antiviral
O capacity
O .

O SUMO-1
O modification
O of
B-protein PML
O is
O known
O to
O be
O required
O for
O the
O formation
O of
O PML
O bodies
O .

O To
O examine
O whether
O Epstein-Barr
O virus
O (
O EBV
O )
O lytic
O replication
O interferes
O with
O PML
O bodies
O ,
O we
O expressed
O the
B-DNA EBV
I-DNA immediate-early
I-DNA genes
B-DNA BZLF1
I-DNA (
I-DNA Z
I-DNA )
O and
B-DNA BRLF1
I-DNA (
I-DNA R
I-DNA )
O in
B-cell_line EBV-positive
I-cell_line cell
I-cell_line lines
O and
O examined
B-protein PML
O localization
O .

O Both
O Z
O and
O R
O expression
O resulted
O in
B-protein PML
O dispersion
O in
B-cell_type EBV-positive
I-cell_type cells
O .

O Z
O but
O not
O R
O expression
O is
O sufficient
O to
O disrupt
O PML
O bodies
O in
B-cell_line EBV-negative
I-cell_line cell
I-cell_line lines
O .

O We
O show
O that
O dispersion
O of
O PML
O bodies
O by
B-DNA Z
O requires
O a
O portion
O of
O the
B-DNA transcriptional
I-DNA activation
I-DNA domain
O of
B-DNA Z
O but
O not
O the
O DNA-binding
O function
O .

O As
O was
O previously
O reported
O for
O the
B-protein HSV-1
I-protein ICP0
I-protein and
I-protein CMV
I-protein IE1
I-protein proteins
O ,
B-DNA Z
O reduces
O the
O amount
O of
B-protein SUMO-1-modified
I-protein PML
O .

O We
O also
O found
O that
B-DNA Z
O itself
O is
O SUMO-1
O modified
O (
O through
O amino
O acid
O 12
O )
O and
O that
B-DNA Z
O competes
O with
B-protein PML
O for
O limiting
O amounts
O of
B-protein SUMO-1
O .

O These
O results
O suggest
O that
O disruption
O of
O PML
O bodies
O is
O important
O for
O efficient
O lytic
O replication
O of
O EBV
O .

O Furthermore
O ,
B-DNA Z
O may
O potentially
O alter
O the
O function
O of
O a
O variety
O of
O cellular
O proteins
O by
O inhibiting
O SUMO-1
O modification

O The

O However

O Similarly

O Collectively

O CONCLUSION
O :
O Arthritis
O induced
O by
B-protein mBSA
O /
B-protein IL-1
O is
O strain
O specific
O and
O dependent
O on
B-cell_type CD4+
I-cell_type T
I-cell_type lymphocytes
O and
O at
O least
O partially
O on
B-protein RelB
O ,
O but
O not
O on
B-cell_type B
I-cell_type lymphocytes
O or
B-protein antibody
O .

B-protein IL-1
O contributes
O to
O leukocyte
O recruitment
O to
O the
O synovium
O and
O directly
O induces
O chemokine
O mRNA
O production
O by
B-cell_type synovial
I-cell_type cells
O .

O This
O model
O of
O acute
O monarticular
O arthritis
O is
O particularly
O suitable
O for
O further
O investigations
O into
O cell-mediated
O immunity
O in
O arthritis
O and
O the
O role
O of
B-protein IL-1
O .

O Positive
O and
O negative
O regulation
O of
O granulopoiesis
O by
B-protein endogenous
I-protein RARalpha
O .

O Acute
O promyelocytic
O leukemia
O (
O APL
O )
O is
O always
O associated
O with
O chromosomal
O translocations
O that
O disrupt
O the
B-DNA retinoic
I-DNA acid
I-DNA receptor
I-DNA alpha
I-DNA (
I-DNA RARalpha
I-DNA )
I-DNA gene
O .

O Whether
O these
O translocations
O relate
O to
O a
O role
O for
B-protein endogenous
I-protein RARalpha
O in
O normal
O granulopoiesis
O remains
O uncertain
O because
O most
O studies
O addressing
O this
O question
O have
O used
O non-physiological
O overexpression
O systems
O .

O Granulocyte
O differentiation
O in
O cells
O derived
O from
O RARalpha-deficient
O (
O RARalpha
O (
O -/-
O )
O )
O mice
O was
O studied
O and
O evaluated
O in
O the
O context
O of
B-protein agonist-bound
I-protein and
I-protein ligand-free
I-protein RARalpha
O .

O Our
O results
O demonstrate
O that
B-protein RARalpha
O is
O dispensable
O for
O granulopoiesis
O ,
O as
O RARalpha
O (
O -/-
O )
O mice
O have
O a
B-cell_type normal
I-cell_type granulocyte
I-cell_type population
O despite
O an
O impaired
O ability
O to
O respond
O to
O retinoids
O .

O However
O ,
O although
O it
O is
O not
O absolutely
O required
O ,
B-protein RARalpha
O can
O bidirectionally
O modulate
O granulopoiesis
O .

B-protein RARalpha
O stimulates
O differentiation
O in
O response
O to
O exogenous
O retinoic
O acid
O .

O Furthermore
O ,
O endogenous
O retinoids
O control
O granulopoiesis
O in
O vivo
O ,
O as
O either
O vitamin
O A-deficient
O mice
O or
O animals
O treated
O with
O an
O RAR
O antagonist
O accumulate
O more
B-cell_type immature
I-cell_type granulocytes
O in
O their
O bone
O marrow
O .

O Conversely
O ,
B-protein RARalpha
O acts
O to
O limit
O differentiation
O in
O the
O absence
O of
B-protein ligand
O because
B-cell_type granulocyte
I-cell_type precursors
O from
O RARalpha
O (
O -/-
O )
O mice
O differentiate
O earlier
O in
O culture
O .

O Thus

O the
O block
O in
O granulopoiesis
O exerted
O by
B-protein RARalpha
B-protein fusion
I-protein proteins
O expressed
O in
B-cell_type APL

O may

O In

B-DNA human
I-DNA and

I-DNA genes
O ,

I-cell_type cells
O as

O .

O The

O binds
O to

O important
B-DNA regulatory
I-DNA sites
O from

I-DNA genes
O with

O to

O Neither

O of

O under

O ,
O of

O .

O Theileria
O is

O CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION
O :
O These

O but
O not
O vascular
O adhesion

O in
B-cell_type mesangial
I-cell_type cells
O and
O promote
O leukocyte
O adhesion
O through
O up-regulation
O of
B-protein intercellular
I-protein adhesion
I-protein molecule-1
O through

O We
O conclude
O that
O hyperglycaemia

O to
O be
O an

B-cell_type Human

B-cell_type Mesangial

O play

O .

O We
O have
O studied
O in
B-cell_line cultured
I-cell_line human
I-cell_line mesangial
I-cell_line cells
O (
B-cell_line CHMC
O )
O several
O effects
O of
O 9-cis
O retinoic

O (
O 9-cRA
O )
O ,
O an
O activator
O of

B-protein retinoic
I-protein acid
I-protein receptors
O (
B-protein RARs
O )
O and
B-protein retinoid
I-protein X
I-protein receptors
O (
B-protein RXRs
O )
O .

O 9-cRA
O inhibited
O foetal
O calf
O serum-induced
B-cell_line CHMC
O proliferation
O .

O It
O also
O prevented
B-cell_line CHMC
O death
O induced
O by
O the
O inflammatory
O mediator
O H
O (
O 2
O )
O O
O (
O 2
O )
O .

O This
O preventive
O effect
O was
O not
O due
O to
O any
O increase
O in
O H
O (
O 2
O )
O O
O (

O )
O catabolism
O and
O it
O persisted
O even
O when

O catalase
O and

O synthesis
O were
O inhibited
O .

O Finally
O ,
O 9-cRA
O diminished
O monocyte
O adhesion
O to

O .

O Interestingly
O ,
O the
O retinoid
O also
O inhibited
O in

O the

O expression
O of

B-protein mesangial
I-protein adhesion
I-protein molecules
O ,
B-protein fibronectin

O ,
O but

O the

O expression
O of

O All

O in

O regardless

O Transcripts

O and

O increased
O after

O ,
O suggesting
O a
O major
O role
O for
B-protein RARs
O and

O in
O 9-cRA-anti-inflammatory
O effects
O .

O 9-cRA
O was

O .

O Cell
O death

O .

O Modulation
O of

O We

O The

O is

O .

O A
O property
O of
O SF
O that
O is

O of

O is
O responsible
O for

O The

O and

O .

O Large
O granular
O lymphocyte
O (

O )
O leukemia
O is
O characterized
O by
O the
O expansion
O of

O .

O These

O are
O resistant
O to

O of

O .

O We

I-cell_type LGL
O from

O patients
O displayed
O high
O levels
O of

O .

O Treatment
O of
B-cell_type leukemic
I-cell_type LGL
O with

O AG-490
O induced

O .

O Moreover
O ,
O using
O an

O ,
O we
O found
O that

O .

O AG-490-induced

O in

I-cell_type LGL
O was
O independent
O of

O .

O However
O ,

O Using

O BACKGROUND
O :

O .

O The

O of
O almost
O all
O of

B-protein cytokines
O produced
O by
B-cell_type eosinophils
O ,
O including
O the

O ,
O is

O .

O OBJECTIVE
O :
O We

O in
B-cell_type resting

O .

O METHODS
O :

O obtained
O from

O of

O .

B-protein NFAT

O analysis
O ,
O DNA-binding
O assays
O ,

O RESULTS
O :
O Both

O .

O Unlike

O ,
O which
O express

O isoforms
O ,
B-cell_type eosinophils
O preferentially

O .

O In
O addition
O ,
B-cell_type eosinophils
O were
O found
O to
O constitutively

O the
B-protein T
I-protein (
I-protein H
I-protein )
I-protein 2
I-protein cytokines
B-protein IL-4
O and
B-protein IL-5
O was
O sufficient
O to
O induce
O the
O nuclear
O translocation
O of
B-protein NFATc
O .

O Eosinophil
O nuclear
O extracts
O contain
O multiple
O factors
O that

O CONCLUSION
O :
B-protein NFATp
O and

O can
O regulate
O the
O expression
O of

O The

I-protein protein
O of

O 1
O (

O )
O has

I-protein proteins
O ,
O and

O that

O to

O .

O One
O of
O the
O challenges
O in
O defining
O the
O molecular
O events
O regulated
O by
B-protein Nef
O has
O been
O obtaining
O good
O expression
O of
B-protein Nef
I-protein protein
O in
B-cell_type T
I-cell_type cells
O .

O This
O has
O been
O attributed
O to
O effects
O of
B-protein Nef
O on
O cell
O proliferation
O and
O apoptosis
O .

O We
O have
O designed
O a
B-protein Nef
I-protein protein
O that
O is
O readily
O expressed
O in
B-cell_line T-cell
I-cell_line lines
O and
O whose
O function
O is
O inducibly
O activated
O .

O It
O is
O composed
O of
O a
O fusion
O between
B-protein full-length
I-protein Nef
O and
O the
B-protein estrogen
I-protein receptor
I-protein hormone-binding
I-protein domain
O (
B-protein Nef-ER
O )
O .

O The
B-protein Nef-ER
O is
O kept
O in
O an
O inactive
O state
O due
O to
O steric
O hindrance
O ,
O and
O addition
O of
O the
O membrane-permeable
O drug
O 4-hydroxytamoxifen
O (
O 4-HT
O )
O ,
O which
O binds
O to
O the
B-protein ER
I-protein domain
O ,
O leads
O to
O inducible
O activation
O of
B-protein Nef-ER
O within
O cells
O .

O We
O demonstrate
O that
B-protein Nef-ER
O inducibly
O associates
O with
O the
B-protein 62-kDa
I-protein Ser/Thr
I-protein kinase
O and
O is
O localized
O to
O specific
O membrane
O microdomains
O (
O lipid
O rafts
O )
O only
O after

O .

O Using
O this
O inducible
B-protein Nef
O ,
O we
O also
O compared
O the
O specific
O requirements
O for
B-protein CD4
O and
B-protein HLA-A2
O downmodulation
O in
O a
B-cell_line SupT1
I-cell_line T-cell
I-cell_line line
O .

O Half-maximal
O downmodulation
O of
B-protein cell
I-protein surface
I-protein CD4
O required
O very
O little
O active
B-protein Nef-ER
O and
O occurred
O as
O early
O as
O 4
O h
O after
O addition
O of
O 4-HT
O .

O In
O contrast
O ,
O 50
O %
O downmodulation
O of
B-protein HLA-A2
O by
B-protein Nef
O required
O 16
O to
O 24
O h
O and
O about
O 50-
O to
O 100-fold-greater
O concentrations
O of
O 4-HT
O .

O These
O data
O suggest
O that
B-protein HLA-A2
O downmodulation
O may
O require
O certain
O threshold
O levels
O of
O active
B-protein Nef
O .

O The

O The
O aim
O of
O this

O was
O to

O METHODS
O :

O was

O .

O DNA-binding

O .

O Sinusoidal

O .

O RESULTS
O :
O Acetaminophen
O caused

O (

O CONCLUSIONS
O :
O The
O inflammatory

O hepatotoxicity
O is

O by

O induction
O of

O However

O and
O does
O not
O affect

O These

O OBJECTIVE
O :
B-protein Tumor
I-protein necrosis
I-protein factor-
I-protein alpha
O (
B-protein TNF-alpha
O )
O induces
O a
O variety
O of
O cellular
O responses
O ,
O some
O of

O being
O at

O .

O Thus
O ,
O we
O set

O to
O find

O in
O the
O modes
O of
O proliferative
O and

O responses
O to

O .

O MATERIALS
O AND
O METHODS
O :
O We
O screened
O a
O panel
O of
B-cell_line acute
I-cell_line myeloid
I-cell_line leukemia-derived
I-cell_line cell
I-cell_line lines
O for
B-protein TNF-
I-protein alpha
O -responsiveness
O .

O In
O two
O lines
O (
B-cell_line OCI-AML-1
O ,
B-cell_line OCI-AML-11
O )
O ,
B-protein TNF-
I-protein alpha
O acted
O as
O an
O apoptotic
O agent
O ;
O in
O others
O (
B-cell_line HU-3
O ,
B-cell_line M-07e
O ,
B-cell_line TF-1
O )
O ,
O it
O had
O the
O opposite
O effect
O ,
O preventing
O apoptosis
O and
O inducing
O proliferation
O .

O Direct
O and
O indirect
O signaling
O mechanisms
O ,
O including
B-protein NF-kappaB
O activation
O and
O cytokine
O synthesis
O ,
O were
O analyzed
O .

O RESULTS
O :
O All
O cell
O lines
O tested
O expressed
B-protein TNF-
I-protein alpha
I-protein receptors
I-protein I
I-protein and
I-protein II
O and
O responded
O to
B-protein TNF-
I-protein alpha
O by
O upregulation
O of
B-protein intercellular
I-protein adhesion
I-protein molecule-1
O .

O In
O contrast
O to
B-protein granulocyte-macrophage
I-protein colony-stimulating
I-protein factor
O (
B-protein GM-CSF
O )
O ,
B-protein TNF-
I-protein alpha
O did
O not
O activate
O the
B-protein MAP
I-protein kinase
O and
O p70S6
O kinase
O pathways
O .

O Nevertheless
O ,
O inhibitors
O of
O these
O pathways
O clearly
O reduced
O the
B-protein TNF-alpha
O -induced
O cell
O growth
O ,
O indicating
O that
B-cell_type TNF-
I-cell_type alpha-proliferative
I-cell_type cells
O produced
O a
O growth
O factor
O that
O induced
O proliferation
O upon
O stimulation
O of
O the
O above
O pathways
O .

B-protein Anti-GM-CSF
I-protein antibodies
O inhibited
O the
B-protein TNF-alpha
O -induced
O growth
O ,
O suggesting
O the
O presence
O of
O an
O autocrine
O loop
O for
O cell
O proliferation
O mediated
O by
B-protein GM-CSF
O .

O Supporting
O this
O notion
O ,
B-protein TNF-alpha
O -induced
O upregulation
O of
B-RNA GM-CSF
I-RNA mRNA
O levels
O and
O protein
O secretion
O in
O the
B-protein TNF-alpha
O -proliferative
O ,
O but
O not
O in
O the
B-cell_line TNF-alpha-apoptotic
I-cell_line cell
I-cell_line lines
O .

O CONCLUSION
O :
O These
O data
O identify
B-protein GM-CSF
O synthesis
O as
O an
O early
O and
O essential
O step
O in
O TNF-
O alpha-induced
O proliferation
O .

O We
O show
O for
O the
O first
O time
O that
B-cell_line TNF-alpha-treated
I-cell_line cell
I-cell_line lines
O producing
O no
O or
O only
O minimal
O amounts
O of
B-protein GM-CSF
O demonstrate
O an
O apoptotic
O phenotype
O ,
O while
O cell
O lines
O with
O high
B-protein GM-CSF
O expression
O rates
O can
O escape
O from
O growth
O arrest
O or
O even
O apoptosis
O .

O In
O this
O context
O ,
O we
O discuss
O arguments
O pointing
O at
B-protein NF-kappaB
O as
O regulator
O of
B-protein GM-CSF
O synthesis
O and
O thus
O indirectly
O as
O regulator
O for
O the
O escape
O of

O Prior

O Here

O )
O ,

O supported

O Stimulation
O probably

O to

O We
O have

O that

O radiation
O induces
O tyrosine
O phosphorylation
O in
B-cell_type human
I-cell_type B-lymphocyte
I-cell_type precursors
O by
O stimulation
O of
O unidentified
B-protein tyrosine
I-protein kinases
O and
O this
O phosphorylation
O is
O substantially
O augmented
O by
O vanadate
O .

O Ionizing
O radiation
O generates
O reactive
O oxygen
O intermediates
O (
O ROI
O )
O .

O Because
O H2O2
O is
O a
O potent
O ROI
O generator
O that
O readily
O crosses
O the
O plasma
O membrane
O ,
O we
O used
O H2O2
O to
O examine
O the
O effects
O of
O ROI
O on
O signal
O transduction
O .

O We
O now
O provide
O evidence
O that
O the
O tyrosine
O kinase
O inhibitor
O herbimycin
O A
O and
O the
O free
O radical
O scavenger
O N-acetyl-cysteine
O inhibit
O both
O radiation-induced
O and
O H2O2-induced
O activation
O of
B-protein NF-kappa
I-protein B
O ,
O indicating
O that
O activation
O triggered
O by
O ROI
O is
O dependent
O on
O tyrosine
O kinase
O activity
O .

O H2O2
O was
O found
O to
O stimulate
B-protein Ins-1
I-protein ,
I-protein 4
I-protein ,
I-protein 5-P3
O production
O in
O a
O tyrosine
O kinase-dependent
O manner
O and
O to
O induce
O calcium
O signals
O that
O were
O greatly
O augmented
O by
O vanadate
O .

O The
O synergistic
O induction
O of
O tyrosine
O phosphorylation
O by
O H2O2
O plus
O vanadate
O included
O physiologically
O relevant
O proteins
O such
O as
B-protein PLC
I-protein gamma
I-protein 1
O .

O Although
O treatment
O of
O cells
O with
O H2O2
O alone
O did
O not
O affect
O the
O activity
O of
B-protein src
I-protein family
I-protein kinases
O ,
O treatment
O with
O H2O2
O plus
O vanadate
O led
O to
O activation
O of
O the
B-protein p56lck
I-protein and
I-protein p59fyn
I-protein tyrosine
I-protein kinases
O .

O The
O combined
O inhibition
O of
B-protein phosphatases
O and
O activation
O of
B-protein kinases
O provides
O a
O potent
O mechanism
O for
O the
O synergistic
O effects
O of
O H2O2
O plus
O vanadate
O .

O Induction
O of
O tyrosine

O by

O may
O thus
O lead
O to
O many
O of

O ,

O The

O .

O We

O found
O that

O of

O to
O a
O striking
O increase
O in
O the
O number
O of

O .

O We
O believe
O this

O be
O due

O .

O Higher
